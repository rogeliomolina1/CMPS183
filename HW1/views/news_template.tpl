<p>
A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metablolic rates than
previously thought, and as climate change alters their environment a growing
number of bears are unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs.
</p>

<p>
The study, <span><u class="link">published February 2 in <i>Science</i>,</u></span> reveals
the physiological mechanisms behind observed declines in polar bear populations,
said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz.
</p>

<p>
"We've been documenting declines in polar bear survival rates, body condition,
and population numbers over the past decade," he said. "This study identifies
the mechanisms that are driving those declines by looking at the actual energy
needs of polar bears and how ofter they're able to catch seals."
</p>

<p>
Pagano. who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
conducted the study as part of his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where
he has been working with coauthors Terrie Williams and Daniel Costa, both
professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.

  <p>
At the end of the last ice age, a population of polar bears was stranded by the
receding ice on a few islands from the Alaskan mainland and mated with female
polar bears, eventually transforming the polar bear population into brown bears.
